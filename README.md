# CrackingTheCodingInterview
My personal git repository for working through the problems in Cracking the Code Interview 6th Edition.
This repository is just for the sake of personal practice. I intend to primarily use this as a place to practice coding and git.

## Layout
The project is structured such that there is one folder which holds all the Exercises from the book, or paraphrased versions of them, seperated by chapter and question. There are also folders for each language, so solutions can be posted in multiple languages. Each language is then subdivided into chapters. Solutions for each chapter will be posted as files named ExerciseXX.extension. For languages which need multiple files, there will instead be directories named ExerciseXX, within these, there will be files named accordingly.
